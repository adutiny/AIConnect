    <li style="color:white;"><strong>What is AI really?</strong><br><br>
      Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the ability of machines or computer programs to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence to complete. In the context of conversation, AI refers to the use of computer programs or bots that can communicate with humans in a natural language, similar to how humans would communicate with each other. These bots use a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, and other advanced techniques to understand the meaning of the words spoken or typed by humans and generate appropriate responses. The goal of conversational AI is to create a more natural and intuitive way for humans to interact with computers and technology, making it easier to perform tasks and access information. 
    </li><br><br>
    
      <li style="color:white;"><strong>What does it mean to train AI?</strong><br><br>
      Training AI is like teaching a computer program to learn things, like how you learn in school. You show the program many examples(Datasets), and it learns from them to recognize patterns and make predictions as to the answer. The more examples(datasets) it sees, the better it gets at making accurate answers. The goal is to create a computer program that can answer questions like a smart student in school.
      A simple example would be a set of questions with the corrosponding answers would be uploaded to the AI, now it has more specific information about your comapny and or specific clients to generate a very accurate answer.  
    </li><br>
  
    <li style="color:white;"><strong>What is prompt training?</strong><br><br>
      A prompt tells a computer program what it needs to do and helps it to focus on the important information needed to generate a response. An example would be Prompt: Answer as if you are a real esate agent, What is the best neighborhood in Los Angeles? 
      
      Without this prompt the AI answer would be a little vague like this
      "I can't give a personal opinion on the best neighborhood in LA, as it depends on personal preferences. However, I can provide objective information on different neighborhoods to help you make an informed decision based on your needs and preferences." Thanks Bob

      With the prompt it would be like this
      "The best neighborhood in Los Angeles is subjective and depends on personal preferences. Popular and desirable neighborhoods include Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Santa Monica, Brentwood, Westwood, Silver Lake, Echo Park, and Los Feliz. At Bob's real Estate we can help find a neighborhood that fits individual criteria and budget."Thanks Bob

    <li style="color:white;"><strong>What Tech do you use?</strong><br><br>
      AI is a quickly evolving technology as it changes, we will continue to evolve with it and will offer those improvements to our clients. We are currently using OpenAI. 
    </li><br>
      <li style="color:white;"><strong> How can I trust AI to supply my clients with the correct information?</strong><br>
     Although AI is very new, Openai estimates an accuracy of 80% to 98%. However we are using the most accurate version Davinci. We estimate from running 
     our program over two months on actual clients enails that the accuracy for a prompt trained is in the low 90%, for a dataset trained very close to 100%
     It is imperative that AI provides accurate information, use trustworthy data sources, collaborate with knowledgeable experts, and double-check the information yourself. AI should enhance, not replace, human expertise.
     We will also run actiual emails and the AI answers by you before going live so we can fine tune the prompts, datasets and We suggest using our platform to screen potential buyers. After vetting, a trained salesperson should take over to finalize the sale. You can decide when and where they step in. Our platform helps sort through leads, giving salespeople more time to close deals with serious buyers and search for new clients.
    </li><br>
        <li style="color:white;"><strong>Can I see it in action?</strong><br><br>
      Yes, we'd love to set a demo with you and show you how our platform can reduce your costs and close more sales.
